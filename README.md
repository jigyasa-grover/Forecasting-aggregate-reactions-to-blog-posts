# Forecasting aggregate reactions to blog-posts

>In this 21st century, online social media has become theplatform of choice for user interactions over the internet. Initially explored for rudimentary purposes like reading articles, sending messages or watching movies, internet particu-larly social media has sprouted enormously providing means to create, share, tag content and converse creatively. It has now come across as a multifaceted platform serving entertainment, news, classifieds, product advertisements, etc.consequently dominating the way how people accumulate and perceive information in todayâ€™s world of temporal complexities. Thus, fathoming this contemporary social nexus gives valuable insight into human interactions and social psychology. One of the compelling tasks is analysis of the content posted in the rich ecology of internet in form of blog-posts and especially their feedback and reactions to comprehend real-world observations of user behaviour incorporating all elements like trending topics, instant of publishing, verbosity, etc. Undoubtedly, human experts are incompetent to perform this detailed analysis without deploying smart systems to do the required. Hence, dynamically evolving and scalable techniques are looked forward to in this era of multiplexity along with the flexibility to mould the source code to delve into huge amount of raw data from different perspectives and lead to interesting predictions and conclusions by examining such social media documents which are undirected,voluminous and alternating. In this study, we focused on forecasting the aggregate reactions a blog-post might receive in the form of comments in the next chosen interval of time.  We took into account the documents appearing in Hungarian blog-posts crawled as apart of a similar experiment "Feedback Prediction for Blogs" by Krisztian Buza.
